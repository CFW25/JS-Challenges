Create book constructor that has two properties:

Title
Author

And two methods
1. Method named getTitle that returns: "Title: " + instance title
2. Method getAuthor

instantiate constructor by creating 3 new books
Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austen (PP)
Hamlet - William Shakespeare (H)
War and Peace - Leo Tolstoy (WP)

Name the new object instances PP, H, and WP, respectively.

For instance, if I instantiated the following book using this Book constructor function:

Harry Potter - J.K. Rowling (HP)
HP.title ➞ "Harry Potter"
HP.author ➞ "J.K. Rowling"
HP.getTitle() ➞ "Title: Harry Potter"
HP.getAuthor() ➞ "Author: J.K. Rowling"
