You will be provided with an initial array 
(the first argument in the destroyer function), followed by one or more arguments. 
Remove all elements from the initial array that are of the same value as these arguments.

Note: You have to use the arguments object.

So basically we'll have to create a function called destroyer. 
When it will be called they'll provide an array or numbers as the first argument and then one or more arguments as numbers. 
We need to remove all the occurrences of these numbers from the array.

destroyer([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1], 2, 3)

Should return [1, 1] as we remove all the 2's and 3's from the provided array.

Get all the values from the arguments object using Object.values
Remove the first item as it is the provided array
Save all the remaining numbers into a separate array, let's call it destroyerArr
Filter out all the numbers that are into the arr by comparing them to the numbers from the destoryerArr.

function destroyer(arr) {
    // Step 3.        // Step 1.              // Step 2.
    const destroyerArr = Object.values(arguments).slice(1);

    // Step 4.
    return arr.filter(x => !destroyerArr.find(y => y === x));
}

function destroyer(arr) {
    return arr.filter(
        x =>
            !Object.values(arguments)
                .slice(1)
                .find(y => y === x)
    );
}

when the find function will return a number, like: 2 for example, 
by adding ! in front it will be converted to false -> JavaScript "magic". xD
Otherwise if the find function will return undefined, 
because it couldn't find the number in the destroyerArr, 
the ! operation will convert undefined to true -> JavaScript "magic" reloaded!
