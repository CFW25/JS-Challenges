You are in charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the cake will have one candle for each year of her total age. 
When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones. 

Your task is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.

For example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the cake will have 4 candles of height 3, 3, 1, 2, 
she will be able to blow out 2 candles successfully, since the tallest candles are of height 3 and there are such candles.

Create a function: birthdayCakeCandles. It must return an integer representing the number of candles she can blow out.

birthdayCakeCandles has the following parameter: arr - an array of integers representing candle heights.

Solution:
1. create a variable which will store the highest candle height. Let's call this variable: max
2. (a) loop over the array and (b) increase a counter everytime the current item is equal to max
3. if the item is higher than max, reset the counter and also set max to be equal to the item
4. at the end, return the counter
(item is the current candle height from the given arr)

Solution Two:
1. Use Math.max + the array spread operator to get the maximum value from the array
2. use the array's filter method to return an array with only the max values
3. return the length of this filtered array
