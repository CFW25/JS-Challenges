This challenge you will be given a string representing a player's ten frames. 
It will look something like this: 'X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44' (in Java: "X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44"), where each frame is space-delimited, 
'X' represents strikes, and '/' represents spares. 
Your goal is take in this string of frames into a function called bowlingScore and return the players total score.

Frames
In Ten-Pin Bowling there are ten frames per game. 
Frames are the players turn to bowl, which can be multiple rolls. 
The first 9 frames you get 2 rolls maximum to try to get all 10 pins down. 
On the 10th or last frame a player will receive an extra roll each time they get all ten pins down to a maximum of three total rolls. 
Also on the last frame bonuses are not awarded for strikes and spares moving forward.

In this challenge, three frames might be represented like this: 54 72 44. 
In this case, the player has had three frames. On their first frame they scored 9 points (5 + 4), on their second frame they scored 9 points (7 + 2) 
and on their third frame they scored 8 points (4 + 4). 

Strikes
Represented in this challenge as 'X'
So if a player were to have two frames X 54, 
the total score of those two frames would be 28. 
The first frame would be worth 19 (10 + 5 + 4) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).

Spares
Represented in this challenge as '/'
A spare is scored when a player knocks down all ten pins in two rolls. 
In the first 9 frames this will be scored as 10 points plus the next roll. 
So if a player were to have two frames 91 / 54, 
the total score of the two frames would be 24. 
The first frame would be worth 15 (10 + 5) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).
