A bracket sequence is called regular if it is possible to insert some numbers and signs into the sequence 
in such a way that the new sequence will represent a correct arithmetic expression

For a string consisting of only ('s and )'s, determine if it is a regular bracket sequence or not

Example:
Given ()() we could insert (1 + 2) * (2 + 4) whih his valid but (())) is not as it has an extra ) bracket
