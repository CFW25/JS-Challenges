Return the lowest index at which a value (second argument) should be inserted into an array (first argument) once it has been sorted. 
    The returned value should be a number.

For example, getIndexToIns([1, 2, 3, 4], 1.5) should return 1 because it is greater than 1 (which has index 0), 
    but less than 2 (which has index 1).

Likewise, getIndexToIns([20, 3, 5], 19) should return 2 because once the array has been sorted it will look like [3, 5, 20] 
    and 19 is less than 20 (index 2) and greater than 5 (index 1).

Create array, add value, sort array. Check where value is by index number return that value

When compare function is specified, array elements are sorted according to the return value of the compare function. 

For example, when comparing a and b:
If the compare function returns a value less than 0, then a comes first.
If the compare function returns a value greater than 0, then b comes first.
If the compare function returns 0, a and b remain unchanged with respect to each other, but sorted with respect to all other elements.
Hence, since 5 - 20 = -15 which is less than 0, therefore 5 comes first, similarly 20 - 10 = 10 
which is greater than 0, therefore 10 comes before 20, likewise 20 - 75 = -55 which is less than 0, so 20 comes before 75, 
similarly 50 comes before 75, and so on.

Other solutions:
const getIndexToIns = (arr, num) =>
    // Step 1.
    [...arr, num]
        .sort((a, b) => a - b)
        // Step 2.
        .reduce(
            (acc, current, i) => (current === num && acc === -1 ? i : acc),
            -1
        );

let getIndexToIns = (arr, num) =>
    arr.reduce((acc, current) => (num > current ? ++acc : acc), 0);


    The reducer function takes four arguments:

Accumulator (acc) - accumulated value previously returned in the last invocation of the callback
Current Value (cur)
Current Index (idx)
