Given 2 out of 3 angles in a triangle, in degrees.

Function that classifies the missing angle as either "acute", "right", "obtuse" based on its degrees.

- An acute angle is less than 90 degrees
- A right angle is exactly 90 degrees
- An obtuse angle is greater than 90 degrees(but less than 180)

missingAngle(11, 20); //Returns obtuse missing angle 149
